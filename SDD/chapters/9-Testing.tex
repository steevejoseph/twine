\section{API Testing}

\subsection{Postman}
Postman was chosen as the API testing framework, for its balance between functionality, and freeness.
The main features it brings are the use of \textbf{Collections}, used to run multiple requests (and their coresponding tests) simultaneouslty. 
Similarly, fields from the response of one request can be used in another request via chaining.

\section{Unit Testing}
\subsection{Jest}
Jest was voted the \#1 testing framework, according to \href{https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/testing/}{The 2020 State of JS Developer Survey}. 
Other options under consideration were KarmaJs, MochaJS, and Jasmine.

\section{End to End Testing}
\subsection{Playwright}
Playwright was chosen as the end-to-end tool, for its support, its ability to run headless, and its ability to accept config as code.
Other options under consideration were Squish Tools, Selenium, and Pupeteer (with its Jest integration)
